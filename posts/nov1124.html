        <div class="Paragraph_Text">
            <p>Hello and welcome to the KiraBlog!</p>
            <p>My name is Kira, my pronouns are She/Her, and I enjoy doing many things.
            <br>    Some of those things include:
            </p>
            <div class="Home_Page">
                <ul>
                    <li>Video Game Development</li>
                    <li>Drawing</li>
                    <li>Frontend Software Development</li>
                    <li>Playing Video Games</li>
                    <li>Watching TV Shows</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>And too many others to list.</p>
            <p>Some of the projects I associate with myself and my "brand" (whatever that means) include:</p>
            <div class="Home_Page">
                <ul>
                    <li>Momo-Chan Studios</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My label for bigger projects (Video Games, Comics, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The K1raK1raK1lla Youtube Page</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Videos about gaming and other topics (but mostly gaming)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>I had initially created this website to blow off some steam after the disappointing results of the 2024 election. <br >
            However, I found that I could also use it as an escape from twitter and social media in some ways. I also found that <br >
            I could use it to help me hone some of my skills in web Development. <br >
            Truthfully, I do not expect people to actually read this website or even go on here frequently.  But I've found that<br >
            I just do not care, and want to pursue this website anyway.</p>
