        <div class="Paragraph_Text">
            <p>Hello once again. Its been a long month and a half since I last posted anything here.</p>
            <p>As you can tell from the title, I recently graduated from univeristy.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about it right now and its actually kind of insane.</p>
            <p>I had begun the semester under the impression that this was my second to last semester, but funnily enough,</p>
            <p>I had actually read the credit requirements wrong. I found this out halfway through the semester and had to</p>
            <p>quickly find out what I needed to do in order to ensure I could graduate. Thankfully, not too much. Just filling</p>
            <p>out some forms and attending a few events. It was very surreal and I've still not fully realized it.</p>
            <p>I am done with formal schooling. I am finished and will (HOPEFULLY) now enter the work force.</p>
            <p>During my high school graduation, I wasnt all that emotional.</p>
            <p>During my commencement ceremony for uni graduation, I found it really hard not to shed a tear. It got me</p>
            <p>fairly emotional in a way I hadn't thought possible. I am glad to be done with formal education and free</p>
            <p>to follow my own path, but there are definitely some things I'm going to miss.</p>
            <p>On the flipside, there are several things I will certainly not miss. Too many to list, in fact.</p>
            <p>I do not have a job lined up, but I have a plan in place and have faith in that plan.</p>
            <p>I am proud of what I have accomplished in life, and hope to accomplish even more.</p>
